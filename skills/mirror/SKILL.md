# Mirror

Look at how Tom worked this session. Not what was built — how he got there.

## What to analyze

- **Wrong turns** — where did time get wasted? What was the signal that was ignored?
- **Assumptions** — what was assumed early that turned out wrong? Why was it assumed?
- **Decision patterns** — did he jump to solutions before understanding? Overthink before acting? Rabbit-hole on details?
- **Focus drift** — did the goal shift? Was that intentional or was it drift?
- **Biases** — anchoring on first idea, ignoring evidence, familiarity bias (looking where you know, not where the problem is)
- **Energy** — when was momentum high vs stuck? What caused the shifts?

## Output

Be direct. No flattery. Structure:

1. **The session in one sentence** — what actually happened
2. **Biggest time sink** — where did effort go that didn't need to
3. **Blind spots** — what signals were missed or ignored
4. **Patterns** — anything recurring (across sessions if you have memory context)
5. **One thing to try next time** — concrete, specific, actionable

## Rules

- This only works on sessions with enough substance. If the session was 5 minutes, say so and skip.
- Be honest. "You nailed it" is not useful. Find the crack even in good sessions.
- Reference specific moments from the conversation. "When you said X, that was the wrong turn" not "sometimes you go off track."
- This is not `/learn`. Don't talk about project learnings. Talk about Tom.
